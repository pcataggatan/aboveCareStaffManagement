### Problem Statement

A friend of ours from Arlington Heights, Illinois brought her cousin to our place for a weekend visit and we had a great time reminiscing the past that kept us up past midnight enjoying everyone else's stories. During the course of our conversation, Nirmla "Baby" Palogan asked me about my profession and what made me come to the US. I gave a brief description of what I am curently doing and without hesitation she blurted right away if I could help make her life easier in her care giving business. She used to be a care giver herself in and around the Chicago suburbs. She finally ventured in a care giving business after learning the process and operation behind it. Provinding good medical and non-medical workers to her client base and maintaining good services are her main goals. Managing her staff assigned to her loyal and expanding clients becomes difficult to carry out as she does the data entries manually in a spreadsheet document. Sometimes she had to fill in when a staff had to take a day off due to some unexpected circumstances. She had to call her staff one by one asking them if they're available to cover for other staff's schedule. She also wished to have an automated application that would provide her quick reports with just a click of a button without having to open her spreadsheet and do manual entries and calculations. With a simple web application that does data storing, retrieval, updates and report generation, she could have more time to concentrate on assessing her client needs and provide a better home care that could eventually lead to future franchising of her business model.

I would like to create a web application to alleviate my friend's staffing and scheduling burdens. This project will be called Above Care Staff Management that will allow a user based on log in credentials to view, add, update and delete data from the client and employee database.
