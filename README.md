# Pablo Cataggatan's Individual Project

### Problem Statement

A friend of ours from Arlington Heights, Illinois brought her cousin to our place for a weekend visit and we had a great time reminiscing the past that kept us up past midnight enjoying everyone else's stories. During the course of our conversation, Nirmla "Baby" Palogan asked me about my profession and what made me come to the US. I gave a brief description of what I am curently doing and without hesitation she blurted right away if I could help make her life easier in her care giving business. Provinding uniterrupted medical and non-medical srevices to her vclient base is her utmost goal, but managing her staff assigned to these loyal and expanding clients becomes difficult to carry out as she does the data entries manually in a spreadsheet document.

In order to meet her goals, she wanted a solution that:
1. store and access her clients and staff data easily
2. allows her to quickly find a staff for a potential client
3. provides her financial report showing the margin of profits
4. reduce the overall time taken to search for staff availability when their shedule changes

I would like to create a web application to alleviate my friend's staffing and scheduling burdens. It will allow a user based on log in credentials to view, add, update and delete data from the client and staff database. The screens will be user-friendly and easy to use and the data will be rendered nicely on every report page.
